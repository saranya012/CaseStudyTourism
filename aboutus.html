            <h2>About Us</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Kerala was a relatively unknown state among tourist circles until the early 1960s. The first initiative to
            popularize Kerala as a tourist destination was undertaken by Travancore's Prince Consort Col. Godavarma Raja
            (husband of the then Queen of Travancore) started Kerala Tours Limited to popularize key tourist locations
            in Travancore Kingdom. When Travancore merged with India, Kerala Tours Limited became a private entity under
            the Travancore royal family. For more than 20 years since Independence, Kerala trend to ignore tourism as a
            key industry, leaving KTL and other private players to lead the role. In the 1960s, KTL struck gold, by
            collaborating with Thomas Cook and started popularizing Kovalam in western countries which started the
            advent of hippie culture in Kovalam Beach. The strong inflow of tourists into Kovalam, started Kerala
            government to consider tourism as a key industry. Though it tried to nationalize Kerala Tours Limited, it
            soon fell into legal issues. This resulted in the government to think starting a new entity known as Kerala
            Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) IN 1966.The Kerala Tourism Development Corporation is a public sector
            undertaking that conducts and regulates the tourism activities in the Indian state of Kerala. The KTDC is
            headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram and has offices across all the districts of Kerala
