                            headquarters of the Zamorins of Kozhikode since ancient times, this district was the site
                            for many of the Mappila Revolts (uprising against the British East India Company in Kerala)
                            between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram literally means a land atop hills and the region is
                            enriched by three great rivers flowing through it - the Chaliyar, Kadalundi and the
                            Bharathapuzha.</p>
